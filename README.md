Machine learning / computer vision methods are not necessary for this task, thanks to the h.264 motion vectors output by the GPU from the Picamera.
Since we know cars usually travel within a road lane, we can exploit this fact to greatly simplify the processing to be nearly 100x faster using plain Python or GNU Octave code than is achievable with OpenCV.



## Programs

`CaptureMotion.py`
captures h.264 motion vectors from the camera as computed by the GPU, and stores them to `motion.h5`

`CountMotion.py`
counts moving objects in lanes using FFT of spatial motion data
